# BlockManipulation
# DOM Manipulation Showcase

This project demonstrates various DOM manipulations using JavaScript. It allows users to interact with a block element on a web page and modify its position, size, shape, color, and opacity. The project provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls for manipulating the block.

# Features
- Position Manipulation:

  Vertical Position (Y-axis): Users can change the vertical position of the block by adjusting a range slider.
  Horizontal Position (X-axis): Users can change the horizontal position of the block by adjusting a range slider.
- Size Manipulation:

  Scaling: Users can resize the block by adjusting a range slider. The block's size is transformed using a scale factor.

- Opacity Manipulation:

  Opacity: Users can adjust the opacity of the block by using a range slider. The opacity value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).

- Shape Manipulation:

  Shape Selection: Users can choose from three different shapes: square, circle, and rhombus. The selected shape is applied to the block upon clicking the "OK" button.

- Color Manipulation:

  HEX Color: Users can enter a hexadecimal color code to change the background color of the block. Pressing the Enter key applies the color.
  RGBA Color: Users can adjust the red (R), green (G), blue (B), and alpha (A) values using range sliders. The resulting RGBA color is applied to the block in real-time.
